Some scripts to make save scumming in XCom easier. 9 dmg crits are not fun.

In order to use this, you need to enable powershell scripts on your computer. To do so, open powershell as an <b>administrator</b> and run:

>Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

These scripts should be easy to audit, because there's really not much to them. It's literally just a copy command.

Next, download this repo as a zip and extract all the files to your desktop.

Edit "SaveScum.ps1" and "SaveReturn.ps1" and replace the name of your iron man save.

Bind "SaveScum.bat" and "SaveReturn.bat" to keys. I used iCUE to bind it to my forward and back buttons on my mouse. The reason to use the .bat files is so that it won't create a window when it runs.
